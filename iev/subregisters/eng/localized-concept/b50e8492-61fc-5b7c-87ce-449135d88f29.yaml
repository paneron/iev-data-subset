  notes:
  - 'For a function stem:[f ( t )] and a wavelet stem:[psi ( t )]:


    stem:[C_f ( a , b ) = int_(- oo)^(+ oo) f ( t ) psi_(a , b)^( ** ) ( t ) d t]


    where stem:[a] is the scale parameter, stem:[b] is the position parameter, and
    * denotes the complex conjugate.'
  - A discrete wavelet transform is obtained by choosing a finite number of values
    of the two parameters. The inverse transform expresses the function of time as
    a superposition of wavelets.
