  definition: '`φ`* divided by the absolute value of temperature difference Δ`T`,
    thus `K = ((| phi |))/((| Delta T |))`'

  notes:
  - 1 The coefficient of heat transfer is zero for an adiabatic boundary and infinity
    for a diathermic boundary.
  - '`U` are mainly used in building technology.'
  - 3 The coherent SI unit of coefficient of heat transfer is watt per square metre
    kelvin, W/(m^2^·K).
