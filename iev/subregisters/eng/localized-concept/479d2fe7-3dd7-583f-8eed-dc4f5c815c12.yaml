  notes:
  - '`T` of the second order can be represented by `n^2` components `T_((i j))`, generally
    presented in the form of a square matrix, such that `T` attributes to the pair
    of vectors *`U`* and *`V`* the scalar `sum_((i , j = 1))^n T_((i j)) U_i V_j`,
    where `U_i` and `V_j` are the coordinates of vectors *`U`* and *`V`*.'
  - '`n` defined by `n`-linear forms and for which the components have `n` indices.
    Tensors of order 1 are considered as vectors and tensors of order 0 are considered
    as scalars.'
  - '`T`* or `T` ou `vec vec T`. The tensor `T` with components `T_((i j))` can be
    denoted `( T_((i j)) )`.'
  - '`T` is defined by a real part and an imaginary part: `T = A + j B` where `A`
    and `B` are real tensors.'
