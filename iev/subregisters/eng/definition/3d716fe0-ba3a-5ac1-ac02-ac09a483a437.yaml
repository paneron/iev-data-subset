  definition: sound power absorption coefficient attributed to a surface by the Eyring
    reverberation-time equation
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The Eyring reverberation-time equation is:


    stem:[T = ((( 24 ln 10 ) V))/((- c S ln ( 1 - bar alpha )))]


    where:


    stem:[T] is the reverberation time


    stem:[V] is the volume of the room


    stem:[c] is the speed of sound in the contained air


    stem:[S] = Σ stem:[S]~stem:[i]~ is the total area of surfaces of the room


    stem:[bar alpha = Sigma S_i alpha_i // S] is the area-weighted mean Eyring coefficient
    of all the surfaces


    stem:[S]~stem:[i]~ is the area of the stem:[i]-th surface


    stem:[α]~stem:[i]~ is Eyring sound power absorption coefficient attributed to
    the stem:[i]-th surface. The equivalent absorption area of the stem:[i]-th surface
    is stem:[S]~stem:[i]~stem:[α]~stem:[i]~.'
