data:
  definition: the transient recovery voltage following the breaking of the prospective
    symmetrical current by an ideal switching device
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The definition assumes that the switching device or the fuse, for which the prospective
    transient recovery voltage is sought, is replaced by an ideal switching device,
    i.e. having instantaneous transition from zero to infinite impedance at the very
    instant of zero current, i.e. at the "natural" zero. For circuits where the current
    can follow several different paths, e.g. a polyphase circuit, the definition further
    assumes that the breaking of the current by the ideal switching device takes place
    only in the pole considered.
