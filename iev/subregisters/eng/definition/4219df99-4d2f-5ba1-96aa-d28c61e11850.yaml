  definition: state quantity of a system of fixed composition for which the infinitesimal
    increase is equal to the quotient of the heat entering the system by the thermodynamic
    temperature, plus an additional positive term if the change of state is irreversible

  notes:
  - 1 The entropy of a system in a given macrostate is proportional to the logarithm
    of the number of microstates in that macrostate.
  - 2 The coherent SI unit of entropy is joule per kelvin, J/K.
  - 3 Specific entropy, or entropy per mass, is denoted stem:[s].
