  definition: positive electrode of a DC arc plasma torch
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The anode is usually made of a high electrical and thermal conductivity material,
    such as copper, and water cooled.
  - The return current electrode of a transferred plasma torch serves in most cases
    as the anode.
  - In a non-transferred plasma torch, the anode is often the torch nozzle.
