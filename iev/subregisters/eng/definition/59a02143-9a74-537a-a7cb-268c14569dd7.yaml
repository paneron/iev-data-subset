  definition: the process of routing messages in a telecommunication network, where
    the messages are first cut into addressed packets; in certain nodes of the network,
    these packets are received, stored and forwarded onto the appropriate transmission
    channels; at the receiving end, the message is reconstituted from the received
    packets
  examples: []
  notes:
  - A packet occupies a channel only for its duration of transmission; at other times
    the channel is available for the transmission of other packets belonging to the
    same message or to other messages.
