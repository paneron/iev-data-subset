  definition: 'at a given point within a volume element of quasi-infinitesimal volume
    stem:[V], vector quantity equal to the sum, for all free charge carriers within
    the volume element, of the products of electric charge and velocity, divided by
    the volume stem:[V]:


    stem:[J = (1)/(V) sum_((i = 1))^n Q_i v_i]


    where stem:[n] is the number of free carriers within the volume element, stem:[Q]~stem:[i]~
    the electric charge of the stem:[i]^th^ carrier and stem:[*v*]~stem:[i]~ its velocity'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'The flux of the electric current density *stem:[J]* through any directed surface
    S is equal to the electric current stem:[I] through that surface:


    stem:[I = underset(S)( int ) J * e_n d A]


    where stem:[*e*]~n~dstem:[A] is the vector surface element.'
