  definition: bilinear form defined for any pair of vectors of an stem:[n]-dimensional
    Euclidean vector space
  examples: []
  notes:
  - For a given orthonormal base, a tensor stem:[T] of the second order can be represented
    by stem:[n^2] components stem:[T_((i j))], generally presented in the form of
    a square matrix, such that stem:[T] attributes to the pair of vectors *stem:[U]*
    and *stem:[V]* the scalar stem:[sum_((i , j = 1))^n T_((i j)) U_i V_j], where
    stem:[U_i] and stem:[V_j] are the coordinates of vectors *stem:[U]* and *stem:[V]*.
  - A tensor of the second order can be defined by a bilinear form applied to two
    vectors (covariant tensor), to two linear forms (contravariant tensor), or to
    a vector and a linear form (mixed tensor). This distinction is not necessary for
    a Euclidean space. It is also possible to generalize to tensors of order stem:[n]
    defined by stem:[n]-linear forms and for which the components have stem:[n] indices.
    Tensors of order 1 are considered as vectors and tensors of order 0 are considered
    as scalars.
  - 'A tensor is indicated by a letter symbol in bold-face sans-serif type or by two
    arrows above a letter symbol: *stem:[T]* or stem:[T] ou stem:[vec vec T]. The
    tensor stem:[T] with components stem:[T_((i j))] can be denoted stem:[( T_((i
    j)) )].'
  - 'A complex tensor stem:[T] is defined by a real part and an imaginary part: stem:[T
    = A + j B] where stem:[A] and stem:[B] are real tensors.'
