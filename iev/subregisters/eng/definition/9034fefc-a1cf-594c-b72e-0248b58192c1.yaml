  definition: 'the quotient of dstem:[E]~rad~ by the product of stem:[ρ] and dstem:[l],
    where dstem:[E]~rad~ is the energy lost by a charged particle of specified energy
    by radiation in traversing a path length dstem:[l] in a material of density stem:[ρ]:


    stem:[((S_((rad))))/(rho) = (1)/(rho) (( ((d E))/((d l)) ))_((rad))]'
  examples: []
  notes:
  - The energy losses included are those that produce bremsstrahlung.
