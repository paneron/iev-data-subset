  definition: sum of durations of all {{supply interruptions, IEV:692-07-01}} to individual
    customers during a time interval, divided by the number of these supply interruptions
  examples: []
  notes:
  - 'If stem:[t]~stem:[ij]~ is the duration of the stem:[i]th interruption of supply
    to customer stem:[j] and stem:[n]~stem:[j]~ is the number of times customer stem:[j]
    is affected during a time interval of duration stem:[T], then the mean duration
    of a customer interruption is given by


    stem:[T_I = ((sum_i sum_j t_((i j))))/((sum_j n_j))]'
  - Only {{sustained interruptions, IEV:692-07-02}} are considered.
  - The term "customer" represents the end user and not some intermediate distribution
    system or company.
  - Mean duration of a customer interruption can be used to describe past performance
    or to estimate expected future performance.
  - This measure is also equal to {{service unavailability per customer served, IEV:692-08-03}}
    divided by {{interruption frequency per customer served, IEV:692-08-01}}.
