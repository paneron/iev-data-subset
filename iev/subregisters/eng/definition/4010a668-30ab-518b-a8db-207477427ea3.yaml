data:
  definition: a change in the optical characteristics of a material under the influence
    of a magnetic field
  examples: []
  notes:
  - Magneto-optic materials generally are used to rotate the polarization of a linearly
    polarized wave.
  - The most common effect results in a change in refractive index.
